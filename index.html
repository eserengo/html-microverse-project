                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of
                web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
                or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
                <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
                Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other
                people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

                <p>Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules that teach HTML from the ground up — no previous knowledge required.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><h4>Introduction to HTML</h4><p>This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax such as looking at applying HTML to text,
                how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a web page.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Multimedia and embedding</h4><p>This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images
                can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.</p></li>
                <li><h4>HTML tables</h4><p>Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic
                table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing captions and summaries.</p></li>
                <li><h4>HTML forms</h4><p>Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with
                websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started
                with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Use HTML to solve common problems</h4><p>Provides links to sections of content explaining how to use HTML to solve very common problems when creating a web page:
                dealing with titles, adding images or videos, emphasizing content, creating a basic form, etc.</p></li>

                <h4>CORS enabled image</h4>
                <p> The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the eleme
                    nt to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
                </p>
                <h4>CORS settings attributes</h4>
                <p>Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you 
                    configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.</p>
                </p><h4>Preloading content with rel="preload"</h4>
                <p>The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. 
                    This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.</p>

                <h2>Reference</h2>
                <h4>HTML reference</h4>
                <p>HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to
                     each other with links.</p>
                     <h4>HTML attribute reference</h4>
                <p>Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their
                     behavior in various ways.</p>
